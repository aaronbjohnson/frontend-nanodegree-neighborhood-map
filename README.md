### Project Goals

The goal of this project was to develop a single page application centered
around one of my favorite neighborhoods. The map shows markers for my favorite
locations in that neighborhood as well as a list view of those locations that
can control the display of information about each place. Third-party APIs —
Foursquare and Google Street View Image — were used to asynchronously deliver 
current information about each location. A search and filter function was 
implemented to display or hide the markers and list items based on matching 
letters entered into a search bar above the map. 

I used the Knockout.js framework to keep the UI updated whenever the data model 
is changed and to connect the Google map markers to their respective list items.
I used the Bootstrap framework to make the overall layout responsive on both 
larger screens and on mobile screens.
